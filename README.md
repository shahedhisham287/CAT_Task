# CAT_Task

## Overview

This notebook focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset as part of a recruitment task. The main objectives are to ensure data integrity, extract meaningful insights, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling. The steps include:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and examining its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing or incorrect values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions, relationships, and patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and refining features to enhance analysis and predictive capabilities.
5. **Insights and Visualizations**: Highlighting key findings using visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Key Steps and Highlights

### 1. Data Exploration
- Initial examination of the dataset using `head()`, `info()`, and duplicate checks.
- Identified incorrect and missing values that could impact analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Addressed invalid or irrelevant values to maintain data integrity.
- Handled missing data using appropriate techniques.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Derived new features to improve the dataset's utility.
- Applied techniques like fuzzy matching for string-based column refinement.

### 4. Insights
- Uncovered trends and relationships using visualizations and summary statistics.
- Highlighted potential issues or areas of interest for further exploration.
